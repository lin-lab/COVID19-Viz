This graph on the left shows the projected new cases per week based on the
latest estimates of Rt. The three lines show the projections based on the upper
95% confidence interval of Rt, the estimate of Rt, and the lower 95% confidence
interval of Rt. The slider shows what the projected case rate would be if the Rt
is scaled by its value. Each point on the graph indicates the start of a week.
