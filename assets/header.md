The effective reproduction number (Rt) characterizes the COVID-19 spread rate,
defined as the average number of secondary infectious cases produced by a
primary infectious case. It's used to define the potential for spread at a
specific time. If Rt > 1, the virus will spread out and the disease will become
an epidemic; if Rt = 1, the virus will spread locally and the disease is
endemic; if Rt < 1, the virus will stop spreading and the disease will disappear
eventually. Below are some visualizations to show the Rt, case rate / million,
or death rate / million. See the About page for more information.

Use slider to adjust date. Click on an area to see its Rt over time.
